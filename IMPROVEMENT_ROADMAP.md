# Milou CLI Improvement Roadmap

## Executive Summary

The current Milou CLI tool provides basic functionality for managing the Milou application stack, but has several critical issues that need addressing. This document outlines a comprehensive improvement plan to transform it into a production-ready, secure, and user-friendly tool.

## Current Issues Analysis

### ðŸ”´ Critical Security Issues
1. **Hardcoded GitHub Token** - Token `ghp_EXAMPLE_TOKEN_REDACTED_FOR_SECURITY` is exposed in .env file
2. **Weak Random Generation** - Uses `/dev/urandom` without proper validation
3. **No Input Sanitization** - Parameters aren't validated before use
4. **Insecure File Permissions** - Configuration files have default permissions

### ðŸ”´ Functional Issues
1. **Docker Image Mismatch** - CLI uses versioned images while main project builds locally
2. **Incomplete Backup/Restore** - Volume data backup not implemented
3. **No Rollback Mechanism** - Failed updates can leave system broken
4. **Missing Network Management** - Hardcoded network assumptions
5. **Poor Error Recovery** - Limited ability to recover from failures

### ðŸ”´ Usability Issues
1. **Poor UX** - Generic error messages without actionable guidance
2. **No Progress Indicators** - Long operations provide minimal feedback
3. **Missing Prerequisites Check** - Doesn't verify system requirements
4. **No Interactive Setup** - Forces users to remember command-line flags

### ðŸ”´ Code Quality Issues
1. **Code Duplication** - Similar patterns repeated across files
2. **Global Dependencies** - Functions depend on global state
3. **Inconsistent Error Handling** - Mixed return codes and exit patterns
4. **Missing Documentation** - No standardized function comments

## Implementation Details

### Security Improvements

```bash
# Secure credential storage example
store_github_token() {
    local token="$1"
    
    # Validate token format
    if ! validate_github_token "$token"; then
        error_exit "Invalid GitHub token format"
    fi
    
    # Store in system keyring or encrypted file
    if command -v keyctl >/dev/null 2>&1; then
        echo "$token" | keyctl padd user "milou-github-token" @u
    else
        # Fallback to encrypted storage
        echo "$token" | openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -out "$CONFIG_DIR/.token.enc"
        chmod 600 "$CONFIG_DIR/.token.enc"
    fi
}
```

### Enhanced Error Handling

```bash
# Improved error handling with recovery suggestions
handle_docker_error() {
    local exit_code="$1"
    local operation="$2"
    
    case "$exit_code" in
        125)
            error_exit "Docker daemon error during $operation. Try: sudo systemctl restart docker"
            ;;
        126)
            error_exit "Permission denied. Try: sudo usermod -aG docker $USER && newgrp docker"
            ;;
        127)
            error_exit "Docker not found. Install Docker: https://docs.docker.com/install/"
            ;;
        *)
            error_exit "Unknown Docker error ($exit_code) during $operation"
            ;;
    esac
}
```

### Progress Indicators

```bash
# Enhanced progress indication
show_progress_with_steps() {
    local total_steps="$1"
    local current_step="$2"
    local message="$3"
    
    local percentage=$((current_step * 100 / total_steps))
    local bar_length=50
    local filled_length=$((percentage * bar_length / 100))
    
    printf "\r[$current_step/$total_steps] %s [" "$message"
    printf "%${filled_length}s" | tr ' ' '='
    printf "%$((bar_length - filled_length))s" | tr ' ' '-'
    printf "] %d%%" "$percentage"
    
    if [[ $current_step -eq $total_steps ]]; then

    local old_config="$1"
    local new_config="$2"
    
    log "INFO" "Migrating configuration from $old_config to $new_config"
    
    # Backup old config
    cp "$old_config" "$old_config.backup.$(date +%s)"
    
    # Transform configuration with validation
    while IFS='=' read -r key value; do
        if validate_config_key "$key" "$value"; then
            echo "$key=$value" >> "$new_config"
        else
            log "WARN" "Skipping invalid config: $key=$value"
        fi
    done < "$old_config"
    
    # Set secure permissions
