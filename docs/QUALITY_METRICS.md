## 🔍 Monitoring Procedures

### Automated Quality Checks

#### 1. **Test Execution Monitoring**
```bash
# Run complete test suite with performance monitoring
./tests/run-all-tests.sh

# Expected Output:
# - All tests pass (117/117)
# - Coverage report generated
# - Performance benchmarks recorded
# - Quality gates validated
```

#### 2. **Code Quality Analysis**
```bash
# Static analysis for shell scripts

```bash
# Benchmark CLI startup
time ./milou.sh --version

# Benchmark state detection
time ./milou.sh status

# Memory usage monitoring
